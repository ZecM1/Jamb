## NOTE

This project was initially created while learning JavaScript in December 2023, serving as a significant milestone in understanding the language better. A new version of the project, enhanced with additional features and improvements, was recreated in April 2024 to showcase what I have learned in the short amount of time and to show how much I am still willing and have yet to learn.
